# Notes
- It would be good if the database had transactions
- transactions could be used to make an UNDO / REDO stack
- That would require all state to be in the DB to prevent the logic from not getting out of sync
- Functional programming language, that is passed the DB and returns a change list?
- Google docs as the back end?
- What do you want to do when specifying a new ruleset
  - Rapid prototyping / rough in, then refine
  - Structs / fields of primitive data or references to other structs
  - Form design / Pre-designed and dynamically generated, good automated layout -> custom layout
  - Information hiding / from all players, between players
  - Rules / State transition definition 
  - Easily fill tables / Custom parsing of human text to DB e.g. Comma separated list to sub-table
